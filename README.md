# Explanation
This is a simple widget/plugin created for the [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/) framework that allows you to input pictures into your surveys and set hot areas in those pictures, which after clicking will be evaluated as choices from the survey.

# Setup
 All you need to do is include the `HotAreaWidget.js` in your survey webpage and your desired configuration into the JSON you get from the survey builder. 
 
The widget will be visible and functional when viewed in the survey builder, but because of the limitation with builder customization, we have build our own `coordsTool` you can use to generate the configuration JSON.

You can find a simple example usage in the `test` directory
